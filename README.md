please download the get_scan_angle notebook and the norm_xyz.npy file only.
There is a simply function in the notebook. Input the ra, dec, epoch, and directory of norm_xyz.npy file (not including the name of the file), and get the ra/dec components (tan(theta) and cot(theta)) of the scan direction. 

Note: I don't know for sure whether it is scan or anti-scan direction. But the result is coherent. Either always along-scan or always anti-scan.
