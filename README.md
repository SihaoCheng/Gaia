# scan-angle
please ONLY download the get_scan_angle notebook and the norm_xyz.npy file.
There is a simply function in the notebook. Input the ra, dec, epoch, and directory of norm_xyz.npy file (not including the name of the file), and get the ra/dec components (tan(theta) and cot(theta)) of the scan direction. 

Note: I don't know for sure whether it is scan or anti-scan direction. It can be the case that for some days I extracted along-scan direction but for others anti-scan direction.
